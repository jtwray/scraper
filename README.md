# scraper
[my first project] a database compiled of data scrapings to assist in well-informed, more frugal purchases relative to my roommate's vitamin/supplement regimen.
In other words, i want to help her cut the amount of timeshe has to spend scrolling through the web comparing prices looking for the best deal for the money while still getting a quality product.
Ideally, the finished application will have the ability to accept input in the form of :
          price
          availability
          brand
          product name
          quantity
          reviews
          rating
These parameters would be used to compile and return an ordered list of relevant products.

This will be a python script, as that is the language im most proficient so far in my coding career.
Im using the atom editor and beautiful soup 4 as well as cmder command line
 - Python v 3.6
 - Atom
 - Beautiful Soup 4
 - CMDER

What i have put together so far is based on a YouTube video I'm emulating:
"Intro to Web Scraping with Python and Beautiful Soup" by
'Data Science Dojo'.

Indirect guidance from Rafeh Qazi's youtube channel, the 'Clever Programmer' as well as his program the 'Profitable Programmer'
 and other various sources on Youtube aka "YOUTUBE UNIVERSITY";).
